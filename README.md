# Analyze A/B Test Results
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 2

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists

## Project Overview 
This project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert,"
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
Goal is to understand whether the company should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
